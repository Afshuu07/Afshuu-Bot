## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
The application follows a modular, event-driven architecture centered around the Bailey WhatsApp client:

- **Bailey Bot Core** (`bot-bailey.js`): Main application entry point using @whiskeysockets/baileys library with multi-device authentication, enhanced connection handling, and auto-welcome systems
- **Bailey Message Handler** (`handlers/baileyMessageHandler.js`): Bailey-specific message processing with compatibility layer for existing commands
- **Legacy Message Handler** (`handlers/messageHandler.js`): Maintains compatibility with whatsapp-web.js style commands and provides fallback support
- **Enhanced Command System** (`commands/index.js`): Comprehensive modular command structure featuring categorized menus, interactive tutorials, audio/video downloads, game recommendations, and security features
- **Configuration Management** (`config/settings.js`): Centralized configuration system supporting environment variables for deployment flexibility
- **Advanced Spam Detection** (`utils/spamDetector.js`): Real-time message analysis system with pattern recognition, threat assessment, and automatic response capabilities
- **Media Processing** (`utils/mediaDownloader.js`, `utils/videoDownloader.js`): Handles audio/video downloads from multiple platforms using yt-dlp integration

### Authentication Strategy
Uses Bailey's multi-file authentication state system which provides:
- Multi-device support (can be connected to multiple devices simultaneously)
