## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
The application follows a modular, event-driven architecture centered around the WhatsApp Web client:

- **Bot Core** (`bot.js`): Main application entry point that initializes the WhatsApp client with enhanced Puppeteer configuration, handles authentication flow, and manages auto-welcome systems
- **Message Handler** (`handlers/messageHandler.js`): Central message processing unit that routes incoming messages to appropriate command handlers with spam detection integration
- **Enhanced Command System** (`commands/index.js`): Comprehensive modular command structure featuring categorized menus, interactive tutorials, audio downloads, and security features
- **Configuration Management** (`config/settings.js`): Centralized configuration system supporting environment variables for deployment flexibility
- **Advanced Spam Detection** (`utils/spamDetector.js`): Real-time message analysis system with pattern recognition, threat assessment, and automatic response capabilities
- **Media Processing** (`utils/mediaDownloader.js`): Handles audio downloads from multiple platforms using yt-dlp integration

### Authentication Strategy
Uses NoAuth strategy from whatsapp-web.js to prevent profile conflicts and browser lock issues. Requires QR code scanning each session but ensures reliable startup and eliminates profile-related errors in containerized environments.

### Logging System
Custom logging implementation with:
- File-based logging with automatic rotation
- Configurable log levels
- Maximum file size and retention policies
- Both console and file output

### Enhanced Command Processing
Commands use a prefix-based system (default: '.') with comprehensive features:
- **Categorized Menu System**: Commands organized into media, security, group, and fun categories
- **Interactive Tutorial**: 5-step guided tutorial for new users
- **Audio Download Integration**: Multi-platform audio extraction with yt-dlp
- **Security Commands**: URL scanning, threat reporting, and protection status
- **Enhanced Formatting**: Attractive visual design with emojis and animations
- Cooldown mechanisms to prevent spam
- Owner-only command restrictions
- Group-specific command limitations
- Argument parsing and validation

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling throughout the application with graceful degradation and detailed logging for debugging purposes.

### Advanced Security Features
- **Real-time Spam Detection**: Advanced pattern recognition for scams, phishing, and spam
- **URL Security Scanning**: Automatic threat assessment for suspicious links
- **Threat Reporting System**: User-driven security reporting with automated analysis
- **Flood Protection**: Message frequency monitoring and automatic warnings
- **Content Analysis**: Multi-layered analysis including keyword detection, pattern matching, and behavior tracking
- Rate limiting and anti-spam mechanisms
- Owner verification system
- Blocked numbers management
- Allowed groups configuration
